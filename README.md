## About Api

This is REST api with JWT authentification. Default guard is web, but if you use api, guard is with JWT.
So if you have other app on other server and you want to use this REST api, you will be autentificated with JWT. But if your views are on the same server, you can use default guard  'web' for authentiification and in that case your app will use session.

App is about crud operations for users and posts. Be free to explore code and clone project if you need something like this.
